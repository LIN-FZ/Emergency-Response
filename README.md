This repository accompanies the paper “Empowering Building Emergency Response with Large Language Models and BIM-Based Knowledge Graphs.” 
It stores generated knowledge-graph data and related resources. The **KG** folder contains multiple knowledge graphs, including the complete **all\_elements** case that encodes rich semantic information (entities and relationships). The **response** folder provides corresponding application cases and example files that illustrate the practical behavior of the emergency response system across different scenarios. In addition, a complete dataset for Named Entity Recognition (**entity\_recognition.csv**) is included for model training and evaluation.
